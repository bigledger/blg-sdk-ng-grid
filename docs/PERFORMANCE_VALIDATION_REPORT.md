*Note: Exact comparisons depend on data complexity, browser, and hardware*

## Performance Bottlenecks Identified

### Current Limitations
1. **Large Dataset Initial Load**: 500k+ rows may take 30+ seconds initially
2. **Complex Filtering**: Multiple simultaneous filters can impact performance
3. **Export Operations**: Large dataset exports may take several minutes
4. **Browser Memory Limits**: Very large datasets may hit browser memory limits

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Server-side Processing**: For extremely large datasets
2. **Incremental Loading**: Load data in chunks as needed
3. **Column Virtualization**: For grids with many columns
4. **Web Workers**: Move heavy computations off main thread

## Recommendations

### For Different Dataset Sizes

#### Small Datasets (1k-10k rows)
- Use default configuration
- All features enabled
- No special optimizations needed

#### Medium Datasets (10k-50k rows)
- Enable virtual scrolling (auto-enabled)
- Consider pagination for better UX
- Monitor memory usage

#### Large Datasets (50k-250k rows)
- Virtual scrolling essential
- Consider server-side sorting/filtering
- Disable unnecessary features (animations, etc.)
- Monitor memory usage closely

#### Extra Large Datasets (250k+ rows)
- Implement server-side processing
- Use pagination instead of virtual scrolling
- Consider data streaming
- Implement lazy loading
- Use Web Workers for heavy operations

### Development Best Practices

1. **Always use TrackBy functions** for better change detection
2. **Implement OnPush change detection** where possible
3. **Avoid complex cell renderers** for large datasets
4. **Batch operations** when possible
5. **Monitor memory usage** during development
6. **Test with realistic data volumes**

### Production Deployment

1. **Set appropriate memory limits**
2. **Implement error boundaries** for memory issues
3. **Monitor real-world performance**
4. **Provide user feedback** during long operations
5. **Implement progressive enhancement**
