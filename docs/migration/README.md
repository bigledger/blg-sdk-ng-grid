## üõ†Ô∏è Migration Tools & Utilities

### Automated Migration CLI
```bash
# Install the migration CLI
npm install -g @blg/migration-cli

# Analyze your current project
blg-migrate analyze

# Generate migration plan
blg-migrate plan

# Execute migration with backup
blg-migrate execute --backup
```

### Configuration Converters

#### ag-Grid Config Converter
```typescript
import { convertAgGridConfig } from '@blg/migration-tools';

// Your existing ag-Grid configuration
const agGridOptions = {
  columnDefs: [...],
  rowData: [...],
  enableSorting: true
};

// Convert to BLG Grid configuration
const blgGridConfig = convertAgGridConfig(agGridOptions);
```

#### Chart.js Config Converter
```typescript
import { convertChartJsConfig } from '@blg/migration-tools';

// Your existing Chart.js configuration
const chartJsConfig = {
  type: 'line',
  data: {...},
  options: {...}
};

// Convert to BLG Charts configuration
const blgChartConfig = convertChartJsConfig(chartJsConfig);
```

### Component Scanners

#### Dependency Scanner
Analyze your project to identify components that can be migrated:

```bash
# Scan for migration opportunities
blg-migrate scan --project ./src

# Results:
# ‚úì Found 12 ag-Grid instances (can migrate)
# ‚úì Found 8 Chart.js charts (can migrate) 
# ‚úì Found 3 TinyMCE editors (can migrate)
# ‚úì Found 15 custom export functions (can consolidate)
```

## üéØ Migration Strategies

### 1. Big Bang Migration
Migrate entire application at once for maximum benefits.

**Best for:**
- New projects or major version upgrades
- Small to medium applications
- Teams with migration experience

**Timeline:** 1-4 weeks depending on application size

### 2. Gradual Migration
Migrate components one by one over time.

**Best for:**
- Large enterprise applications
- Risk-averse organizations
- Limited development resources

**Timeline:** 2-6 months with ongoing development

### 3. Hybrid Approach
Run old and new components side-by-side during transition.

**Best for:**
- Critical production systems
- Complex applications with tight deadlines
- Teams needing time to train on new components

**Timeline:** 3-12 months with parallel systems

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration Considerations

### Planning Phase
- **Dependency Analysis** - Identify all components to migrate
- **Feature Inventory** - Catalog current features and customizations
- **Risk Assessment** - Identify potential breaking changes
- **Timeline Planning** - Set realistic migration schedules

### Execution Phase
- **Backup Strategy** - Always backup before migration
- **Testing Plan** - Comprehensive testing of migrated components
- **Rollback Plan** - Have contingency plans for issues
- **User Training** - Train team on new component APIs

### Post-Migration
- **Performance Monitoring** - Track performance improvements
- **User Feedback** - Gather feedback on new features
- **Optimization** - Fine-tune configurations for best performance
- **Documentation Updates** - Update internal documentation
