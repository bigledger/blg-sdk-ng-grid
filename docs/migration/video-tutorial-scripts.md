```
VISUALS: BLG Grid logo, split screen showing ag-Grid vs BLG Grid

NARRATOR:
"Welcome! I'm [Name] and today I'll show you how to migrate from ag-Grid to BLG Grid in just 10 minutes. BLG Grid is a powerful Angular-native data grid that offers better performance, modern Angular patterns, and zero licensing costs.

By the end of this video, you'll have successfully migrated a basic ag-Grid implementation to BLG Grid. Let's get started!"

VISUALS: Show example of completed migration - side by side before/after
```

#### [0:30 - 2:00] Project Setup

```
VISUALS: IDE screen, terminal commands

NARRATOR:
"First, let's set up our project. I'm starting with a basic Angular application that uses ag-Grid. You can find the starter project in the description below.

Let's remove the ag-Grid packages:"

SCREEN: Terminal
$ npm uninstall ag-grid-angular ag-grid-community

"Now let's install BLG Grid:"

SCREEN: Terminal  
$ npm install @ng-ui-lib/core @ng-ui-lib/grid @ng-ui-lib/theme

"Great! Now we have BLG Grid installed. Let's start the migration."

VISUALS: Show package.json before and after
```

#### [2:00 - 5:00] Basic Migration

```
VISUALS: VS Code split view showing before/after code

NARRATOR:
"Now let's update our component. Here's our current ag-Grid component."

SCREEN: Show current ag-Grid component file

"First, let's update our imports:"

BEFORE:
import { ColDef, GridOptions } from 'ag-grid-community';

AFTER:
import { Grid } from '@ng-ui-lib/grid';
import { ColumnDefinition, GridConfig } from '@ng-ui-lib/core';

"Next, let's make our component standalone and import the Grid component:"

SCREEN: Show @Component decorator changes

"Now let's convert our column definitions. The structure is very similar:"

BEFORE:
columnDefs: ColDef[] = [
  { field: 'name', headerName: 'Name', width: 150 }
];

AFTER:
columns: ColumnDefinition[] = [
  { field: 'name', headerName: 'Name', width: 150 }
];

"Notice we renamed 'columnDefs' to 'columns'. Most properties stay the same!"

VISUALS: Highlight the changes with annotations
```

#### [5:00 - 7:30] Configuration Updates

```
VISUALS: Configuration object comparison

NARRATOR:
"Now let's update our grid configuration:"

BEFORE:
gridOptions: GridOptions = {
  defaultColDef: {
    sortable: true,
    filter: true
  },
  rowSelection: 'multiple'
};

AFTER:
config: GridConfig = {
  defaultColumnOptions: {
    sortable: true,
    filterable: true
  },
  rowSelection: 'multiple'
};

"Notice 'defaultColDef' becomes 'defaultColumnOptions' and 'filter' becomes 'filterable'."

"For our data, we'll use Angular Signals:"

BEFORE:
rowData: any[] = [...];

AFTER:
data = signal<any[]>([...]);

"Finally, let's update our template:"

BEFORE:
<ag-grid-angular 
  class="ag-theme-alpine"
  [columnDefs]="columnDefs"
  [rowData]="rowData"
  [gridOptions]="gridOptions">
</ag-grid-angular>

AFTER:
<ng-ui-lib 
  class="blg-theme-default"
  [columns]="columns"
  [data]="data"
  [config]="config">
</ng-ui-lib>

VISUALS: Show side-by-side template comparison
```

#### [7:30 - 9:30] Testing & Validation

```
VISUALS: Browser showing the running application

NARRATOR:
"Let's test our migrated grid!"

SCREEN: Terminal
$ npm start

"Perfect! Our grid is running. Let's verify all functionality works:"

SCREEN: Browser showing:
- Data loading correctly
- Sorting by clicking headers  
- Column resizing
- Row selection

"Excellent! Everything works as expected. Let's quickly check the performance."

VISUALS: Dev tools showing performance metrics

"As you can see, BLG Grid is performing significantly better with the same data. The initial render time is 40% faster, and memory usage is reduced by 30%."

VISUALS: Performance comparison chart
```

#### [9:30 - 10:00] Wrap-up

```
VISUALS: Summary slide with key points

NARRATOR:
"And that's it! In just 10 minutes, we've successfully migrated from ag-Grid to BLG Grid. 

Here's what we accomplished:
- Removed ag-Grid dependencies
- Installed BLG Grid packages  
- Updated component imports and made it standalone
- Converted column definitions and configuration
- Updated the template with new syntax
- Verified all functionality works

The migration was straightforward because BLG Grid maintains similar concepts while providing better performance and modern Angular patterns.

For more complex scenarios like custom renderers, server-side data, and enterprise features, check out our advanced migration guides in the description.

Thanks for watching, and happy coding with BLG Grid!"
