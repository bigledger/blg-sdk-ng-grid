I would like to create a speaking avatar like what you can find in Sitepal.
We will have 2 different version, one is 2D and the other one is 3D.

As you know, the modern browser can render the avatar, i would like to create a few avatar,
1) Young man
2) Young woman
3) middle age man
4) middle age woman

So, when you download and evaluate the tools below, find something that we can use to create 
For open source and free realistic human 3D models that can be used as presenters, here are some options:

Free Realistic 3D Human Models (Open Source/Free):

Some platforms like Sketchfab and Free3D provide free 3D human models under Creative Commons licenses, which are often open for use with attribution. These models include photorealistic textures and rigging, suitable for presenters.

3D Scan Store offers highly realistic 3D scans with high-resolution textures for free, usable as detailed human models, though licensing details should be checked.

Renderpeople provides free posed, rigged, and animated 3D people models optimized for photorealistic visualizations.

Blender is an open-source software with a large community offering free realistic human models and tools to animate them.

Open Source or Free Tools for Talking Avatars:

Some tutorials and open-source tools like SadTalker can animate faces and generate talking avatars using driving videos and AI techniques.

We will use open source models, so that we do not infringe any copyright. We will improvise the model, to create different characters. 

The developers, users can change different voice, different languages, different dress / clothes for the models above, so you may need to have the capability to design the fashion, well, nothing fanciful, just normal clothes would do.

As we may be streaming things to say to the speaking avatar, perhaps, using web-socket, in text or in voice , please make the library more robust, so that it can support both mechanism. 

Please make the speaking avatar to have facial expression, more natural, and it should be able to achieve lips sync, so that when speaking the mouth is moving naturally. 

Don't forget the hand gesture etc as well.

We should be able to decide and program what to be shown in the background, for example, like a presentation etc.

I would like to create another library that programmers can easily embed in their angular component, this will be angular native tool that is super optimized for angular, easy to use, include the component, and easy to embed it in any existing Angular application.


Please do the testing , and please provide a very comprehensive documentation.

As this task is rather complex, please make use of multiple sub-agent to accomplish this task, thanks.
